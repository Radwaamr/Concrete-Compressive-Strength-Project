# **Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Project**
In Preif We did: Some analysis and story telling about Concrete Dataset from Kaggle. And doing ML modeling by both Regression and Classification.

More Details:-
# **1. Problem Definition:** Any developed country has paved roads.
   Also has a urban construction and infrastructure at the highest level.
   But.. A road with cracks !!, A bridge has been closed !!
                             
# **2. Dataset Description:** Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering.
   The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. 
   These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, 
   coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.
                              
# **Data Characteristics:** The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) 
   for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled).
                              
**Summary Statistics:**
   * Number of instances (observations): 1030
   * Number of Attributes: 9
   * Attribute breakdown: 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable
   * Missing Attribute Values: None
                              
**Variable Information:** Given is the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit and a brief description.
   The concrete compressive strength is the regression problem. The order of this listing corresponds to 
   the order of numerals along the rows of the database.

   8- Age -- quantitative -- Day (1~365) -- Input Variable
   
   9- Concrete compressive strength -- quantitative -- MPa -- Output Variable

                              
# **3. Analysis:** 
* Univariate Analysis on Strength and making a classification for each category of strength, 
  that makes me converting the problem to not just a regression problem, but also classification!
* Bivariate Analysis on Period of Drying the Concrete with Strength
